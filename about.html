                    Code4CT is broadening perspectives about career opportunities for many girls and is showing them that the ICT sector offers exciting career paths with the opportunity for social impact. Through using coding and web building skills, participants are exposed to how IT skills can be applied to solve problems, and they are encouraged to use their knowledge to tackle a real local challenge.

              <p>
                The applications of this computational approach to problem-solving stretch beyond building beautiful functional websites. It combines mathematics, logic and algorithms, and teaches you a new way to think about the world. In September last year (2014) the UK introduced coding into their primary school curriculum. The Code4CT curriculum achieves a successful balance between skills acquisition and a fun learning environment. Participants acquire these essentials skills in a fun, creative and encouraging spacet.  Once you know how to code, you can create virtual worlds within the computer where the only limit on what is possible is your imagination. We wants to put this power into the hands and hearts of every girl, because soon not knowing the language of computers will be as challenging as being illiterate & innumerate are today.
